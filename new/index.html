 <p align="justify"> The Future Commerce Hackathon focus is understanding and building next generation products, transactions, experiences, relationships and business models. We invite participants to propose topics, speakers and projects. With the partnership of Massachusetts Legal Hackers and the ComputableLaw research team of MIT Media Lab's Human Dynamics group, a strong set of legal resources, talent and innovative new solutions will be made available for participants to leverage as part of addressing key challenges to innovation and entrepreneurship in the new economy. Participants will also have a unique opportunity to learn about and work with blockchain technologies, including but not limited to Bitcoin. Several hackathon teams and symposium speakers will explore examples and opportunities for using blockchains to solve key commercial and legal challenges. The emphasis on law and blockchains are important themes, but participants and teams are encouraged to work on any topics or projects relevant to the future of commerce.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
This is a hybrid online and in-person event, built around a full MIT hackathon, providing resources for team-based projects culminating in a round of competitive judging. The hackathon includes a symposium for participants to engage with experts, top entrepreneurs and thought leaders, and provides a series of skill building, learning and social activities. The event also features opportunities for participation in PrototypeJam style facilitated design sessions working with public and private sector organizations brining challenging problems and collaborating in rapid design and prototyping charrette to develop creative solutions.
Commerce is not only about the exchange of goods and services at mass-scale but also about the interchange of ideas and information. The advent of networks connecting everything, everyone, everywhere all the time has enabled previously impossible opportunities for innovations and invention. Today, with the emergence of powerfully disruptive tools like the Blockchain, Trust Networks and Smart Contracts, the potential of an open Internet can be realized at little cost, in almost no time with a single little hack reflecting a single big idea. This event features an integrated approach to the business, legal and technical dimensions of commerce, providing mentors, tools and other resources to help teams achieve ideas and solutions the work across boundaries.
</p>
<p align="justify">
MIT Media Lab, CIVICS.com and Massachusetts Legal Hackers are convening a varied set of MIT students, creative business innovators, technical entrepreneurs, legal hackers and other to connect, brainstorm, imagine and present FutureCommerce. Join us for this unique participatory event and help re-invent the future.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commerce">Merriam-Webster, commerce is defined as</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) social intercourse: interchange of ideas, opinions, or sentiments, (2) the exchange or buying and selling of commodities on a large scale involving transportation from place to place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will take this standard definition as the starting scope, and hold to a broadly interpreted view of what commerce is and can be.  </p>
