{"name":"FutureCommerce Hackathon","tagline":"Repository for the FutureCommerce Hackathon, November 2015","body":"## MIT Media Lab, CIVICS.com & Massachusetts Legal Hackers \r\n**present**\r\n## FutureCommerce Hackathon: November 20-22, 2015\r\n\r\n[Commerce](http://civics.com/index.html#commerce) is not only about the exchange of goods and services at mass-scale but also about the interchange of ideas and information.  The advent of networks connecting everything, everyone, everywhere all the time has enabled previously impossible opportunities for innovations and invention. Today, with the emergence of powerfully disruptive tools like the Blockchain, Trust Networks and Smart Contracts, the potential of an open Internet can be realized at little cost, in almost no time with a single little hack reflecting a single big idea.  This event features an integrated approach to the business, legal and technical dimensions of commerce, providing mentors, tools and other resources to help teams achieve ideas and solutions the work across boundaries.   \r\n\r\nMIT Media Lab, CIVICS.com and Massachusetts Legal Hackers are convening a varied set of MIT students, creative business innovators, technical entreprenuers, legal hackers and other to connect, brainstorm, imagine and present FutureCommerce.  Join us for this unique participatory event and help re-invent the future.  \r\n\r\n# Learn More and Jump In\r\n\r\n## Event [Registration](http://futurecommercehackathon.eventbrite.com)\r\nTo register, head to Eventbrite: http://futurecommercehackathon.eventbrite.com\r\n\r\n## Hackathon [Landing Page](http://FutureCommerce.civics.com)\r\nCheck out the event webpage at: http://FutureCommerce.civics.com \r\n\r\n## Hackathon GitHub Repository\r\nWe will use the [Hackathon](https://github.com/FutureCommerce/Hackathon) repository in the [FutureCommerce](https://github.com/FutureCommerce) GitHub Organization  \r\n\r\n## Associated [MIT Graduate Seminars](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/MAS/fa15/MAS.S63)\r\nSome teams will be working on related graduate seminars at MIT Media Lab: \r\n* http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/MAS/fa15/MAS.S63 \r\n* http://blockchain.media.mit.edu/syllabus.html\r\n\r\n## What's Next?\r\nIn the coming days and weeks, we will post the draft agenda, a pre-Hackathon schedule of online events when participants, speakers, mentors and others can get to know each other, learn new skills and have an opportunity to pose questions.
